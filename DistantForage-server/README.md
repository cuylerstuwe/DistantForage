# Server Setup

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for your system.

2. Navigate to this directory in a console.

3. Run the following commands in order *(on a Mac/Linux environment, you can optionally combine them with an && between them)*:

- `npm install`
- `node .`

4. The server should print into the console window that it's running. It will remain running as long as you leave this console window running and no errors appear.
